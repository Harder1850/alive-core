# alive-core — Formal Freeze Declaration

alive-core is frozen at **Phase 27**.

This freeze is intentional and architectural.

## What This Means

- No execution authority exists in this repository
- No agents, planners, or autonomous behavior will be added
- No background schedulers or side-effectful loops are permitted
- All decisions terminate at *description*, not action

alive-core serves as a **constitutional cognitive substrate**, not a product.

## Where Development Continues

All experimentation, integration, and acceleration now occurs in:

- Host environments (e.g. CLI, web, LLM access)
- Virtual bodies and adapters
- External systems that consult the core without granting power

## Amendments

Any change beyond Phase 27 requires:
- Explicit proposal
- Formal review
- New phase authorization

Absent that process, this repository remains frozen.
