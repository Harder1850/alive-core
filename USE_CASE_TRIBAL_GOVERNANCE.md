# USE CASE — Tribal Governance, Operations, and Compliance

## 1) Purpose (Plain English)

ALIVE is used in tribal government to keep actions accountable. It helps track what was observed, what was authorized, what was done, and what was refused—so that programs can follow Council intent without silent drift or “we thought someone handled it.”

It solves practical problems that show up during audits and daily operations: unclear authority, missed follow‑through, and actions taken without a clear record. ALIVE does **not** make policy decisions and it does **not** run as an autonomous AI. It records and assists only within explicit authority and clear boundaries.

## 2) Governance Principle

**ALIVE automates actions only when explicitly authorized, and records both actions and refusals.**

## 3) Phase-by-Phase Mapping (Concrete)

### Phase 29 — Experience (Observation Only)

What it looks like in tribal reality:

- Council packets and resolutions (final, approved items)
- Program logs (grant milestones, site visits, project status updates)
- Compliance checklists and deadlines (reporting windows, deliverables)
- Meeting notes that are treated as inputs, not decisions

Key point: Phase 29 is **observation only**. It gathers a record of what happened and what documents exist. It does not decide what to do.

### Phase 30 — Pattern Detection (Neutral Descriptions)

What it looks like in tribal reality (examples of neutral patterns):

- “This type of report is often submitted near the deadline.”
- “Requests for vendor documents cluster at month‑end.”
- “Project close‑out steps repeat in the same order across grants.”

Key point: Phase 30 makes **no judgment** and gives **no recommendations**. It only describes repeatable shapes in the record.

### Phase 31 — Interpretation (Authority‑Bound)

Who interprets in tribal reality:

- Tribal Council (policy intent, priorities, resolutions)
- Program Director or Department Head (operational interpretation within delegation)
- Tribal Attorney / Legal Counsel (compliance meaning, risk framing)
- CFO / Grants & Finance leadership (allowable cost interpretation, reporting intent)

How authority is recorded:

- Council resolutions
- Written delegations of authority
- Signed directives
- Procurement rules and approved policies

Key point: Phase 31 is where meaning is assigned—**by people with authority**. ALIVE does not replace that step.

### Phase 32 — Execution (Only Under Explicit Authority)

Examples of allowed execution in tribal reality:

- Sending a notification to a responsible staff member
- Generating a status report for a meeting packet
- Creating a reminder that a required document is missing

Key safeguards:

- A **kill switch** can stop execution immediately.
- **Receipts** are written for successful actions.
- **Blocked attempts** are also recorded (for example, when authorization is expired or the kill switch is off).

Brief note on Phase 33:

- Phase 33 remains **dormant** (design and governance only; no operational scheduling code).

## 4) Concrete Tribal Scenarios (At Least 3)

### Scenario A — Council Resolutions → Operational Follow‑Through

What ALIVE observes:

- The final resolution text and date
- Assigned department and due dates (if present)
- Supporting documents included in the packet

Who authorizes interpretation:

- Council and/or an authorized administrator (recorded via resolution or written delegation)

What (if anything) is executed:

- A notification to the responsible program lead
- A follow‑up reminder before a known deadline (only if authorized)

What the receipt proves:

- That a notification was sent (or blocked)
- When it was sent
- Under which authority source it was permitted

### Scenario B — Grant & Compliance Tracking

What ALIVE observes:

- Grant award terms, reporting windows, and deliverables
- Submission logs and dates
- Missing documents (for example, required attachments)

Who authorizes interpretation:

- Grants Manager, CFO, and/or Legal Counsel within delegated authority

What (if anything) is executed:

- A compliance status report for leadership
- A notification that a deliverable is approaching or missing

What the receipt proves:

- That the system acted only within authorized limits
- That blocked attempts were recorded (useful evidence that the system refused to act without permission)

### Scenario C — Environmental / Land Management Reporting

What ALIVE observes:

- Monitoring logs, inspection notes, and dates
- Permit reporting deadlines
- Repeated administrative steps (forms, attachments, approvals)

Who authorizes interpretation:

- Environmental Director and/or Tribal Attorney depending on topic

What (if anything) is executed:

- A notification that a reporting window is approaching
- A compiled summary report for internal review

What the receipt proves:

- That a message or report was produced under explicit authority
- That execution could be stopped instantly if conditions changed

## 5) Audit & Compliance Alignment

ALIVE supports audit readiness by making authority and actions visible.

How this helps:

- **Federal audits:** Clear evidence of what was done, when, and under what approval.
- **Self‑governance (PL 638 / compacting):** Demonstrates internal controls, separation of authority, and traceable follow‑through.
- **Internal accountability:** Prevents “silent execution” and reduces ambiguity about who approved what.

Why receipts for blocked actions matter:

- They prove the system refused to act without authorization.
- They show that governance controls are real, not implied.

Why kill switches matter:

- They provide immediate operational control.
- They support safe demonstrations and safe suspension during audits or leadership transitions.

## 6) What ALIVE Is NOT (Important)

ALIVE is not:

- a chatbot
- an AI decision‑maker
- autonomous
- replacing staff
- a recommendation engine

## 7) Deployment Without New Development

ALIVE can be used without writing any new code by:

- Running a controlled pilot on a limited set of internal documents and timelines
- Demonstrating how receipts capture actions and refusals
- Producing read‑only summaries for program management meetings
- Keeping the kill switch off during demonstrations to show “no execution by default”

This approach allows leadership and auditors to evaluate governance value without changing operations.

## 8) One-Sentence Executive Summary

ALIVE helps tribal leadership and staff prove that work follows authority—by recording what was observed, what was approved, what was done, and what was refused.
