# Core Epistemic Knowledge (alive-core)

This directory defines ALIVE-core’s innate epistemic structure.

These files:
- Do NOT contain factual knowledge
- Do NOT change at runtime
- Do NOT execute logic
- Do NOT grow
- Do NOT encode domains

They define how the core:
- interprets memory
- weights confidence
- handles uncertainty
- detects error
- avoids false certainty

Additional educational stacks live in `knowledge/education/` as static reference constants for culturally grounded cognition (aesthetics, ethics, governance, language, science).

This is analogous to human cognitive instincts, not learned facts.
