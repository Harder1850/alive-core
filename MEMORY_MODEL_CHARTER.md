# ALIVE Memory Model Charter — Model-Delta + Forgetting

Principle: Memory is model change, not data retention.

## Core Assertion

The system must not store experiences verbatim as long-term memory.
It may store only the delta that an experience produces in an internal model, and only when authorized.

## What Counts as Memory

Memory is defined as:

- a rule
- a constraint
- a relationship
- a boundary
- a corrected assumption

If an experience does not change a model, it is not memory.

## Forgetting Is the Default

- Raw experiences decay
- Repetition without novelty collapses
- Redundancy is discarded
- Only changes that survive repeated compression are eligible for memory

Forgetting is not loss.
Forgetting is compression working.

## Memory Formation Rules

Memory may be formed only when:

- A Phase 31 interpretation exists
- Authority explicitly approves promotion
- The delta can be stated independently of its source
- The memory can be invalidated later

## Prohibited Memory Forms

The system must never store as memory:

- full documents
- transcripts
- logs
- books
- conversations
- raw embeddings without semantic grounding

These are inputs, not memory.

## Memory Must Be Revisable

All memory entries must include:

- source authority
- formation date
- invalidation mechanism
- confidence bounds (if applicable)

Memory that cannot be revised is belief, not memory.

## Why This Matters

Without forgetting:

- systems bloat
- recall becomes brittle
- confidence grows without justification
- errors fossilize

Human cognition avoids this by forgetting aggressively.

ALIVE must do the same.
