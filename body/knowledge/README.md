# Knowledge Layer — Non-Cognitive State Contract

## Status

CONSTITUTIONAL — NON-NEGOTIABLE

This document defines what knowledge means inside the ALIVE Virtual Body and enforces a strict separation between stored information and understanding.

Any deviation from this contract introduces cognition into the Body and violates the Brain–Body separation.

## Purpose

The Knowledge layer exists to store, retrieve, and manage non-cognitive information required for the Body to operate procedurally.

It enables:

- continuity of operation
- access to external facts
- efficient execution
- reversible learning experiments

It does not enable understanding.

## Foundational Principle

The Body may store facts.
It must never know what they mean.

Meaning belongs exclusively to the Brain.

## What Body Knowledge IS

Body knowledge is:

- informational
- contextual
- replaceable
- domain-specific
- operationally useful

Examples include:

- cached web content
- retrieved documents
- API responses
- datasets
- game state
- lookup tables
- configuration snapshots
- indexes
- embeddings (as opaque artifacts)

This knowledge supports action, not judgment.

## What Body Knowledge IS NOT

Body knowledge is not:

- beliefs
- preferences
- values
- goals
- interpretations
- world models
- mental state
- self-concept
- long-term identity

Those belong to the Brain — or nowhere.

## No Normative Processing

The Knowledge layer must not:

- rank truth
- infer importance
- resolve contradictions
- assess credibility
- judge relevance
- prefer one fact over another
- discard information as “wrong”

If a choice must be made, it is escalated to the Brain.

## Replaceability Rule

All Body knowledge must be disposable.

- It must be safe to delete
- It must be safe to regenerate
- It must be safe to swap sources
- It must be safe to corrupt (for testing)

If deleting knowledge breaks identity, the architecture has failed.

## No Silent Promotion to Memory

Body knowledge must never:

- become permanent memory
- influence identity
- survive without revalidation
- be silently promoted upward

Only events feed learning.
Only the Brain derives memory.

## Read-Only to the Brain

The Brain may:

- query Body knowledge
- request summaries (descriptive only)
- reason about retrieved information

The Brain must never:

- modify Body knowledge directly
- rely on Body knowledge as truth
- treat cached data as authoritative

All knowledge is provisional.

## Allowed Operations

The Knowledge layer may:

- store data
- retrieve data
- index data
- expire data
- invalidate data
- version data
- redact sensitive fields
- tag metadata (source, time, origin)

All operations are procedural.

## Forbidden Operations

The Knowledge layer must not:

- learn patterns
- update heuristics
- optimize retrieval for “better answers”
- self-organize meaningfully
- merge data to reduce ambiguity
- infer relationships
- draw conclusions

If it “feels smart,” it’s wrong.

## Interaction With Events

All knowledge-related activity must be observable.

Examples:

- cache miss
- cache hit
- data invalidation
- source change
- corruption detected

These are events, not internal secrets.

## Why This Matters

Most AI systems collapse because:

- knowledge quietly becomes belief
- caches become truth
- heuristics become values
- state becomes identity

This contract prevents:

- epistemic drift
- hidden bias accumulation
- irreversible learning
- silent corruption of reasoning

## Invariant Summary

The following must always hold:

- Body knowledge is disposable.
- Body knowledge has no meaning.
- Body knowledge does not influence judgment.
- Body knowledge is not identity.
- Body knowledge is not memory.

Violation of any invariant turns the Body into a mind — which is forbidden.

## Final Statement

The Knowledge layer exists to hold information without caring about it.

Caring is cognition.
Cognition belongs to the Brain.

This file exists to make sure the Body never forgets that.
