ALIVE Core Constitutional Boundary Contract

1. Purpose

This document defines the permanent, non-negotiable boundaries of alive-core.

Its purpose is to:

Prevent architectural drift

Preserve safety guarantees

Maintain portability across devices

Separate cognition from action

Ensure long-term auditability and trust

This contract applies to all current and future development of alive-core.

2. Definition of ALIVE Core

alive-core is a cognitive substrate, not an agent.

It is responsible for:

interpreting experience

deriving memory

ranking recall

surfacing uncertainty

detecting incoherence

recommending stabilization actions

It is not responsible for acting on the world.

3. Absolute Prohibitions (What Core Will Never Do)

The following are permanently forbidden in alive-core:

3.1 Execution & Action

Core will never:

execute actions

invoke tools or adapters

schedule tasks

control actuators

initiate side effects

access the operating system

perform IO (filesystem, network, devices)

3.2 Autonomy & Agency

Core will never:

act autonomously

pursue goals

optimize objectives

make decisions that change the external world

override external authority

self-direct execution

3.3 Planning & Strategy

Core will never:

generate plans

sequence actions

select strategies

allocate resources

perform optimization

reason about cost/benefit for execution

3.4 Domain Authority

Core will never:

embed mutable domain knowledge

contain encyclopedic facts

encode laws, regulations, or policies

hardcode cultural, political, or religious doctrines

freeze domain truths into its architecture

3.5 Self-Modification

Core will never:

modify its epistemic constants

rewrite its own invariants

change confidence priors at runtime

alter boundary definitions

evolve its constitution autonomously

4. Guaranteed Responsibilities (What Core Must Always Do)
4.1 Memory Derivation

Core must:

derive memory only from experience

treat experience as immutable

ensure memory is bounded

enforce forgetting and decay

remain replayable and deterministic

4.2 Epistemic Discipline

Core must:

distinguish belief from fact

surface uncertainty explicitly

treat confidence as provisional

penalize contradiction

prefer evidence over assertion

avoid false certainty

4.3 Recall Responsibility

Core must:

rank recall deterministically

expose confidence and uncertainty

preserve conflicting memories

avoid suppressing disagreement

bound recall outputs

4.4 Self-Stabilization (Non-Executable)

Core must:

detect incoherence

detect confidence collapse

detect memory pollution

recommend resets with evidence

never execute resets itself

4.5 Portability

Core must:

operate on constrained devices

remain small and bounded

avoid hardware assumptions

avoid platform-specific logic

preserve identity across embodiments

5. Knowledge Constraints
5.1 What Core May Contain

Core may contain only:

epistemic primitives

ontological categories

confidence priors

reasoning heuristics

explicit cognitive limits

All such knowledge must be:

static

immutable

domain-agnostic

versioned

auditable

5.2 What Core Must Not Contain

Core must not contain:

factual databases

historical records

scientific corpora

legal codes

cultural narratives

procedural manuals

dynamic knowledge stores

All mutable or expansive knowledge belongs outside core.

6. Relationship to Other ALIVE Components
6.1 alive-core

Thinks

Remembers

Doubts

Explains

Recommends

6.2 alive-body

Acts

Executes

Interfaces with the world

Owns authority and consequences

6.3 alive-system / orchestration

Coordinates components

Enforces boundaries

Routes information

Maintains lifecycle control

Core never bypasses these layers.

7. Invariant Enforcement

All changes to alive-core must preserve:

Determinism

Replayability

Bounded memory

Explicit uncertainty

Non-execution

Authority separation

Violations of this contract are considered architectural regressions, regardless of functionality gained.

8. Amendment Policy

This contract may only be amended if all of the following are true:

The amendment is explicitly documented

The safety impact is analyzed

Portability is preserved

No execution authority is added

The change is approved as a new architectural phase

Absent these conditions, this contract is immutable.

9. Declaration

By maintaining this contract, ALIVE ensures that:

The core remains a brain, not a body;
a judge, not an actor;
a witness, not a weapon.

This boundary is intentional.
This boundary is permanent.
