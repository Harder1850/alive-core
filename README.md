# alive-core
The authoritative cognitive core of the ALIVE system. Defines identity, continuity, arbitration, and memory invariants. No UI. No agents. No blocking.

## 🚀 Demo: Continuity, Memory, and a Single Cognitive Core

This repository is not a chatbot.

It is the cognitive core of an AI system designed around a single, continuous stream of awareness with persistent experience and memory.

This demo demonstrates continuity over time — the most important property missing from most AI systems.

## 🧠 What You’re Seeing

ALIVE-Core is built around three ideas:

### One Spine (Conscious Loop)

There is exactly one authoritative cognitive loop.
No background agents decide anything. No committees. No hidden schedulers.

### Experience ≠ Memory

Everything that happens is recorded as experience (append-only).
Memory is derived later through summarization and consolidation.

### Continuity Across Restarts

The system does not “reset” when stopped.
It wakes up, remembers, and continues.

## ▶️ Demo: Wake, Remember, Continue

### Step 1 — Start the system

Run the system normally (local, offline supported).

On startup, ALIVE-Core will wake up.

### Step 2 — Observe the wake-up narrative

Instead of starting blank, the system produces a brief narrative such as:

“I’m back.
Since I was last awake, I handled several user interactions, updated preferences, and recorded new experiences.
Here’s what mattered most…”

This narrative is not prewritten and not stored verbatim.
It is generated from an immutable experience stream recorded over time.

### Step 3 — Interact normally

Issue commands, provide input, or let the system operate within its allowed capabilities.

All meaningful events are recorded as experience.

### Step 4 — Stop and restart

Shut the system down completely.
Restart it later.

On the next startup, ALIVE-Core again wakes up and explains what it remembers, maintaining continuity of identity and context.

## 🧾 Why This Is Different

Most AI systems:

- forget everything when restarted
- treat history as disposable
- mix cognition, memory, and execution together
- rely on hidden background processes

ALIVE-Core:

- enforces a single conscious loop
- keeps experience immutable
- derives memory intentionally
- runs locally and offline
- treats intelligence like an operating system, not a chat session

There is no “magic.”
Everything is explicit, testable, and auditable.

## 🔌 Capabilities (Foundation for Expansion)

ALIVE-Core maintains a capability registry that describes what the system can control at any moment — software tools, hardware devices, or services.

The brain does not assume power.
It asks: “What capabilities are available right now?”

This design allows the same cognitive core to:

- act as a personal assistant
- operate a computer or OS
- control a robot or vehicle
- run fully offline on embedded hardware

without changing the spine.

## 🧩 Current State

Today, this system demonstrates:

- persistent experience
- identity continuity
- deterministic wake-up behavior
- strict cognitive invariants
- local execution without cloud dependency

It is intentionally minimal — designed to be extended safely, not hacked together.

## 🛣️ What Comes Next

This demo is the foundation for:

- long-term memory consolidation
- natural language voice control
- adaptive planning
- multi-device operation
- embodied systems (robots, vehicles)

Those layers build on top of this core — not inside it.

## ✨ One-Sentence Summary

ALIVE-Core is a system that remembers being alive.
